# 🚀 Netlify Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Prepare Your Files
Make sure you have these files in your project folder:
- ✅ `index.html` (main entry point)
- ✅ `excel_web_processor.js` (JavaScript)
- ✅ `excel_web_processor.css` (Styling)
- ✅ `sample_structure.html` (Documentation)

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Drag & Drop (Easiest)
1. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
2. Drag your entire project folder to the deployment area
3. Wait for deployment to complete
4. Your site is live! 🎉

#### Option B: GitHub Integration (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Deploy on Netlify:
   - Visit [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository
   - Click "Deploy site"

### Step 3: Customize Your Domain
1. In your Netlify dashboard, go to "Site settings"
2. Click "Change site name" to get a custom subdomain
3. Or add a custom domain in "Domain management"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **404 Error**: Make sure `index.html` is in the root directory
- **JavaScript not loading**: Check that `excel_web_processor.js` is in the same folder
- **CSS not loading**: Verify `excel_web_processor.css` exists

### File Structure Check:
```
your-project/
├── index.html                    ← Must be in root
├── excel_web_processor.js       ← Must be in root
├── excel_web_processor.css      ← Must be in root
└── sample_structure.html        ← Optional
```
